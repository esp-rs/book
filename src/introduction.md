# Introduction

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive guide on using the [Rust Programming Language][rust] with [Espressif][espressif] devices.

Rust support for these devices is still a work in progress, and progress is being made rapidly. Because of this, parts of this documentation may be out of date or change dramatically between readings.

For tools and libraries relating to Rust on ESP, please see the [esp-rs organization][esp-rs] on GitHub. This organization is managed by employees of Espressif as well as members of the community.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for people with some experience in Rust and also assumes rudimentary knowledge of embedded development and electronics. For those without prior experience, we recommend first reading the [Assumptions and Prerequisites][prerequisites] and [Resources][resources] sections to get up to speed.

[prerequisites]: #assumptions-and-prerequisites
[resources]: #resources

### Assumptions and Prerequisites

- You are comfortable using the Rust programming language and have written and run applications in a desktop environment.
- You should be familiar with the idioms of the [2021 edition][rust-2021], as this book targets Rust 2021.
- You are comfortable developing embedded systems in another language such as C or C++, and are familiar with concepts such as:
  - Cross-compilation
  - Common digital interfaces like `UART`, `SPI`, `I2C`, etc.
  - Memory-mapped peripherals
  - Interrupts
