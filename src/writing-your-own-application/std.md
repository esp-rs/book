# Writing std applications

If you want to learn how to develop `std` application, there is a training developed
alongside [Ferrous Systems]:

- [Book of training]
- [Repository of the training]

The training is based on [ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1]. You can use any other Espressif development board, but code changes and configuration changes might be needed.

The training is split into two parts:

* [Introductory level examples]:
   * A basic hardware-check ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/intro/hardware-check))
   * An HTTP Client ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/intro/http-client))
   * An HTTP Server ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/intro/http-server))
   * An MQTT Client ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/intro/mqtt))
* [Advanced level examples]:
   * Low-level GPIO
   * Interrupts in General
   * I2C Driver ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/advanced/i2c-driver))
   * I2C Sensor Reading ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/advanced/i2c-sensor-reading))
   * GPIO/Button Interrupts ([Source](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/espressif-trainings/tree/main/advanced/button-interrupt))
   * Driving an RGB LED


> Note that there are several examples covering the use of specific peripherals under the examples' folder of  [`esp-idf-hal`]. I.e. [`esp-idf-hal/examples`].
