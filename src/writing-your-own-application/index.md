# Writing Your Own Application

With the appropriate Rust compiler and toolchain installed, you're now ready to create an application.

You can write an application in the following ways:

- (**Strongly recommended**) Generate from a template: Gives you a configured project, saves time, and prevents possible errors.
- Start from scratch using Cargo: Requires more expertise since you need to configure several parts of the project.
    > ⚠️ **Note**: Starting a project with Cargo doesn't provide any advantage, only mentioned here since it's the usual way of generating a project in Rust.

This chapter won't cover the instructions on how to create a project from scratch with `cargo`, it will only focus on generating a project from a template project.

The tools used in this chapter will be covered in more detail in the next chapter [Tooling][tooling], feel free to refer to it when required.
