# Writing Your Own Application

With the appropriate Rust compiler and toolchain installed, you're now ready to create an application.

There are essentially two ways to do this: generating from a template or starting from scratch using only `cargo`.

We strongly recomend starting projects from templates as it gives you a configured project saving all the time that would require
to setup a project started from scratch with `cargo`.

This chapter wont cover the instructions on how to create a project from scratch with `cargo`, it will only focus on generating a project from template poject.

During this chapter, we will use some tools that will be covered in more details in the next chapter, [Tooling][tooling], feel free to peek into it when required.
