# Introduction

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive guide on using the [Rust programming language] with [Espressif] SoCs and modules.

Rust support for these devices is still a work in progress, and progress is being made rapidly. Because of this, parts of this documentation may be out of date or change dramatically between readings.

For tools and libraries relating to Rust on ESP, please see the [esp-rs organization] on GitHub.

> #### A note in SoCs support.
>
> The content of the books applies to ESP32, ESP32-S, and ESP32-C series of SoCs.
> ESP8266 series is out of the scope of this book, support for Rust in ESP8266 is limited and only some parts
> of the book are applicable for this SoC.
