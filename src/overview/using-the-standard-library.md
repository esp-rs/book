# Using the Rust Standard Library (`std`)

Espressif provides a C-based development framework called [esp-idf] which has support for all Espressif chips starting with the ESP32; note that this framework does _not_ support the ESP8266.

`esp-idf` in turn provides a [newlib] environment with enough functionality to build the Rust standard library (`std`) on top of it. This is the approach that is being taken to enable `std` support on ESP devices.

## Chip Support

In order for applications targeting `std` to be built for ESP devices, two things are required:

1. LLVM/Clang support
2. Support for the device in question in `esp-idf`

Refer to the table below to see if your chip is supported.

|   Chip   | Supported? |
| :------: | :--------: |
|  ESP32   |     ✅     |
| ESP32-C2 | _planned_  |
| ESP32-C3 |     ✅     |
| ESP32-S2 |     ✅     |
| ESP32-S3 |     ✅     |
| ESP32-H2 | _planned_  |
| ESP8266  |     ❌     |

Since `esp-idf` does not have support for the ESP8266, we unfortunately are unable to use these libraries with it. See the [Bare Metal] page for information on the `no_std` HAL for this chip.

## Standard Library Features

The supported `std` features are as follows:

- Threads
- Mutexes and other synchronization primitives
- Collections
- Random number generation
- Sockets

In addition to the `std` features there is an [embedded-svc] implementation for `esp-idf`, [esp-idf-svc], which adds extra support for services/modules not available in the standard library, including:

- Wi-Fi management
- NVS (non-volatile storage)
- Networking services like `httpd` and `ping`

In general, this approach should feel quite similar to developing for most normal PC environments.

## FAQ

### I updated my `sdkconfig.defaults` file but it doesn't appear to have had any effect

You must clean your project and rebuild in order for changes in the `sdkconfig.defaults` to take effect:

```shell,ignore
$ cargo clean
$ cargo build
```

### The documentation for the crates mentioned on this page is out of date or missing

Due to the [resource limits] imposed by [docs.rs], internet access is blocked while building documentation and as such we are unable to build the documentation for `esp-idf-sys` or any crate depending on it.

Instead, we are building the documentation and hosting it ourselves on GitHub Pages.

[`esp-idf-sys` Documentation]

Documentation for the remaining crates will be made available soon in the same way.

[resource limits]: https://docs.rs/about/builds#hitting-resource-limits
[docs.rs]: https://docs.rs
[`esp-idf-sys` documentation]: https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-sys/esp_idf_sys/

### \*\*\*ERROR\*\*\* A stack overflow in task main has been detected.

If the second-stage bootloader reports this error, you likely need to increase the stack size for the main task. This can be accomplished by adding the following to the `sdkconfig.defaults` file:

```ignore
CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=7000
```

In this example, we are allocating 7kB for the main task's stack.
