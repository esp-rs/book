# Wokwi
[Wokwi] is an online simulator that supports simulating Rust projects (both `std` and `no_std`) in ESP Chips,
see [wokwi.com/rust] for a list of examples and a way to start new projects.

Wokwi offers WiFi simulation, Virtual Logic Analyzer, and [GDB debugging] among many other features, see
[Wokwi documentation] for more details. For ESP chips, there is a [table of simulation features that are currently supported].
## Using wokwi-server
[wokwi-server] is a CLI tool for launching a Wokwi simulation of your project. I.e., it allows you
to build a project on your machine, or in a container, and simulate the resulting binary.

[wokwi-server] also allows simulating your resulting binary on other Wokwi projects, with more hardware parts other than the chip itself. See the [corresponding section of the wokwi-server Readme] for detailed instructions.
