# Writing Your Own Application

With the appropriate Rust compiler and toolchain installed, you're now ready to create an application.

You can write an application in the following ways:

- Generate from a template: (**Strongly recommended**). Gives you a configured project, saves time and prevents possible errors.
- Start from scratch using Cargo: Requires more expertise since you need to configure several parts of the project.
    > Note: Starting a project with Cargo does not provide any advantage, only mentioned here since its the usual way of generating a project in Rust.


This chapter won't cover the instructions on how to create a project from scratch with `cargo`, it will only focus on generating a project from template project.

During this chapter, we will use some tools that will be covered in more details in the next chapter, [Tooling][tooling], feel free to peek into it when required.
