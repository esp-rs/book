# Understanding esp-template

Now that we know how to [generate a no_std project], let's inspect what the generated
project contains and try to understand every part of it.

## Inspecting the generated Project

When creating a project from [esp-template] with the following answers:
-  Which MCU to target? · `esp32c3`
-  Use template default values? · `true`

For this explanation we will use the default values, if you want further modifications, see the [additional prompts] when not using default values.


It should generate a file structure like this:

```text
├── .cargo
│   └── config.toml
├── src
│   └── main.rs
├── .gitignore
├── Cargo.toml
├── LICENSE-APACHE
├── LICENSE-MIT
└── rust-toolchain.toml
```

Before going further, let's see what these files are for.

- [.cargo/config.toml]
    - The Cargo configuration
    - This defines a few options to correctly build the project
    - Contains `runner = "espflash flash --monitor"` - this means you can just use `cargo run` to flash and monitor your code
- src/main.rs
    - The main source file of the newly created project
    - For details, see the [`main.rs`] section below.
- [.gitignore]
    - Tells `git` which folders and files to ignore
- [Cargo.toml]
    - The usual Cargo manifest declaring some meta-data and dependencies of the project
- LICENSE-APACHE, LICENSE_MIT
    - Those are the most common licenses used in the Rust ecosystem
    - If you want to apply a different license, you can delete these files and change the license in `Cargo.toml`
- [rust-toolchain.toml]
    - Defines which Rust toolchain to use
      - The toolchain will be `nightly` or `esp` depending on your target.

## `main.rs`

```rust,ignore
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use esp_backtrace as _;
use esp_println::println;
use hal::{clock::ClockControl, peripherals::Peripherals, prelude::*, timer::TimerGroup, Rtc};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
    let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
    let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();

    // Disable the RTC and TIMG watchdog timers
    let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.RTC_CNTL);
    let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);
    let mut wdt0 = timer_group0.wdt;
    let timer_group1 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG1, &clocks);
    let mut wdt1 = timer_group1.wdt;
    rtc.swd.disable();
    rtc.rwdt.disable();
    wdt0.disable();
    wdt1.disable();

    println!("Hello world!");

    loop {}
}
```

That is quite a lot of code. Let's see what it is good for.

- `#![no_std]`
  - This tells the Rust compiler that this code doesn't use `libstd`
- `#![no_main]`
  - The `no_main` attribute says that this program won't use the standard main interface, which is tailored for command-line applications that receive arguments. Instead of the standard main, we'll use the entry attribute from the `riscv-rt` crate to define a custom entry point. In this program, we have named the entry point `main`, but any other name could have been used. The entry point function must be a [diverging function]. I.e. it has the signature `fn foo() -> !`; this type indicates that the function never returns – which means that the program never terminates.
- `use esp_backtrace as _;`
  - Since we are in a bare-metal environment, we need a panic-handler that runs if a panic occurs in code
  - There are a few different crates you can use (e.g `panic-halt`) but `esp-backtrace` provides an implementation that prints the address of a backtrace - together with `espflash`/`espmonitor` these addresses can get decoded into source code locations
- `use esp_println::println;`
  - Provides `println!` implementation
- `use hal:{...}`
  - We need to bring in some types we are going to use
  - These are from `esp-hal`
- `let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();`
  - HAL drivers usually take ownership of peripherals accessed via the PAC
  - Here we take all the peripherals from the PAC to pass them to the HAL drivers later
- `let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();`
  - Sometimes a peripheral (here the System peripheral) is coarse-grained and doesn't exactly fit the HAL drivers - so here we split the System peripheral into smaller pieces which get passed to the drivers
- `let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();`
  - Here we configure the system clocks - in this case, we are fine with the defaults
  - We freeze the clocks, which means we cannot change them later
  - Some drivers need a reference to the clocks to know how to calculate rates and durations
- The next block of code instantiates some peripherals (namely RTC and the two timer groups) to disable the watchdog, which is armed after boot
  - Without that code, the SoC would reboot after some time
  - There is another way to prevent the reboot: [feeding](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/0.2.0/esp32c3_hal/prelude/trait._embedded_hal_watchdog_Watchdog.html#tymethod.feed) the watchdog
- `println!("Hello world!");`
  - Prints "Hello Wolrd!"
- `loop {}`
  - Since our function is supposed to never return, we just "do nothing" in a loop

## Running the Code

Building and running the code is as easy as

```shell
cargo run
```

This builds the code according to the configuration and executes [`espflash`] to flash the code to the board.

Since our [`runner` configuration] also passes the `--monitor` argument to [`espflash`] we can see what the code is printing.

> Make sure that you have [`espflash`] installed, otherwise this step will fail. To install [`espflash`]:
> `cargo install espflash`

You should see something similar to this:

Hello world!
```

What you see here are messages from the first and second stage bootloader, and then ... our "Hello World" message!

And that is exactly what the code is doing.

You can reboot with `CTRL+R` or exit with `CTRL+C`.
