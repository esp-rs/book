# Troubleshooting

Here, we will present a list of common errors that may appear when building a project alongside the reason and a solution to them.

## Environment Variable `LIBCLANG_PATH` Not Set

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to find libclang: "couldn't find any valid shared libraries matching: ['libclang.so', 'libclang-*.so', 'libclang.so.*', 'libclang-*.so.*'], set the `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable to a path where one of these files can be found (invalid: [])"', /home/esp/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/bindgen-0.60.1/src/lib.rs:2172:31
```

We need `libclang` for [`bindgen`] to generate the Rust bindings to the ESP-IDF C headers.
Make sure you have sourced the export file generated by `espup`, see [Set up the environment variables][set-up-the-environment-variables].

[`bindgen`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen
[set-up-the-environment-variables]: ./../installation/riscv-and-xtensa.md#3-set-up-the-environment-variables

## Missing `ldproxy`

```shell
error: linker `ldproxy` not found
  |
  = note: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

If you are trying to build a `std` application [`ldproxy`] must be installed. See [`std` Development Requirements][rust-esp-book-std-requirements]

```shell
cargo install ldproxy
```

## Using the Wrong Rust Toolchain

```text
$ cargo build
error: failed to run `rustc` to learn about target-specific information

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `rustc - --crate-name ___ --print=file-names --target xtensa-esp32-espidf --crate-type bin --crate-type rlib --crate-type dylib --crate-type cdylib --crate-type staticlib --crate-type proc-macro --print=sysroot --print=cfg` (exit status: 1)
  --- stderr
  error: Error loading target specification: Could not find specification for target "xtensa-esp32-espidf". Run `rustc --print target-list` for a list of built-in targets
```

If you are encountering the previous error or a similar one, you are probably not using the proper Rust toolchain. Remember that for `Xtensa` targets, you need to use Espressif Rust fork toolchain, there are several ways to do it:
- A [toolchain override] shorthand used on the command-line: `cargo +esp`.
- Set `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` environment variable to `esp`.
- Set a [directory override]: `rustup override set esp`
- Add a [rust-toolchain.toml] file to you project:
  ```toml
  [toolchain]
  channel = "esp"
  ```
- Set `esp` as [default toolchain].

For more information on toolchain overriding, see the [Overrides chapter of The rustup book].

## Windows

### Long Path Names

When using Windows, you may encounter issues building a new project if using long path names. Follow these steps to substitute the path of your project:
```powershell
subst r: <pathToYourProject>
cd r:\
```

### Missing ABI

```powershell
  Compiling cc v1.0.69
error: linker `link.exe` not found
  |
  = note: The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)

note: the msvc targets depend on the msvc linker but `link.exe` was not found

note: please ensure that VS 2013, VS 2015, VS 2017 or VS 2019 was installed with the Visual C++ option

error: could not compile `compiler_builtins` due to previous error
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: build failed
```

The reason for this error is that we are missing the MSVC C++, hence we are not meeting the [Compile-time Requirements], please install [Visual Studio 2013 (or later) or the Visual C++ Build Tools 2019]. For Visual Studio, make sure to check the "C++ tools" and "Windows 10 SDK" options.
If using GNU ABI, install [MinGW/MSYS2 toolchain].

## FAQ

### `sdkconfig.defaults` File is Updated but it Doesn't Appear to Have Had Any Effect

You must clean your project and rebuild for changes in the `sdkconfig.defaults` to take effect:

```shell
cargo clean
cargo build
```

### The Documentation for the Crates Mentioned on This Page is out of Date or Missing

Due to the [resource limits] imposed by [docs.rs], internet access is blocked while building documentation. For this reason, we are unable to build the documentation for `esp-idf-sys` or any crate depending on it.

Instead, we are building the documentation and hosting it ourselves on GitHub Pages:

- [`esp-idf-hal` Documentation]
- [`esp-idf-svc` Documentation]
- [`esp-idf-sys` Documentation]

[resource limits]: https://docs.rs/about/builds#hitting-resource-limits

[`esp-idf-hal` documentation]: https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-hal/esp_idf_hal/

### A Stack Overflow in Task `main` has Been Detected

If the second-stage bootloader reports this error, you likely need to increase the stack size for the main task. This can be accomplished by adding the following to the `sdkconfig.defaults` file:

```text
CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=7000
```

In this example, we are allocating 7 kB for the main task's stack.

### How to Disable Watchdog Timer(s)?

Add to your `sdkconfig.defaults` file:

```text
CONFIG_INT_WDT=n
CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT=n
```

Recall that you must clean your project before rebuilding when modifying these configuration files.
