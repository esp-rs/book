# What's Left to Explore

We hope this book has prepared you for building real-world applications using Espressif chips and Rust. We've only scratched the surface here, there is plenty more to explore outside of this book. Be sure to check out [the additional resources], if you haven't already.

We're excited to see what you create, be sure to add it to the [awesome-esp-rust] list or use this list for inspiration.

If you're keen to contribute to esp-hal or the ancillary crates directly, checkout [our developer contribution documentation].
