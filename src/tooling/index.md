# Tooling

Now that we have our required dependencies installed, and we know how to generate a
template project, we will cover, in more detail, some tools. These tools will make
developing Rust applications for Espressif chips a lot easier.

In this chapter, we will present `espflash`/`cargo-espflash`, suggest Visual Studio Code as IDE and, dig into the
currently available simulation and debugging methods.
