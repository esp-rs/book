# Introduction

In this introduction, we'll cover two essential topics that will give you a solid foundation for working with Espressif devices in Rust:

1. **[Hardware Overview](./hardware-overview.md)**: Understanding the Espressif ecosystem, including the different SoC families, their architectures, and development boards. This knowledge will help you choose the right chip for your project and understand the underlying hardware you'll be programming.

2. **[Ancillary Crates Overview](./ancillary-crates.md)**: Exploring the rich ecosystem of crates, these crates provide the building blocks for everything from memory allocation to wireless communication.

Understanding both the hardware capabilities and the software ecosystem will prepare you for the practical aspects covered in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) chapter, where you'll set up your development environment and create your first applications.

Let's begin with an overview of the hardware you'll be working with.
