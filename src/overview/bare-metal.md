# Bare Metal (`no_std`)

Using `no_std` may be more familiar to embedded Rust developers; it does not use `std` (the Rust standard library) but instead uses a subset, the `core` library. The [official Rust embedded book] has a [great section on this].

It's important to note that in general a `no_std` crate can always compile in `std` environment but the inverse is not true. Therefore, when creating crates it's worth keeping in mind if it needs to the standard library to function.

## Hardware Abstraction Layers

Previously, the primary focus of `no_std` development was the ESP32 and (to a lesser extent) the ESP8266, via [esp-rs/esp32-hal] and [esp-rs/esp8266-hal].

While `esp32-hal` and `esp8266-hal` have great support for a lot of the onboard peripherals, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are **not** currently supported in a `no_std` enviroment. [esp-rs/esp32-wifi] was created to explore getting it working, but it is not yet functional.

More recently, there has been a renewed effort to implement `no_std` support for the entire lineup of Espressif devices from the ESP32 and newer. These new HALs can be found in the [esp-rs/esp-hal] repository.

## Chip Support

Chip support for `no_std` requires LLVM/Clang support just like for `std`. However, this has no dependency on `esp-idf`. In addition to compiler support, it's necessary to have peripheral access crates (PAC) and hardware abstraction layers (HAL) for your desired chip.

Refer to the table below to see if your chip is supported. Please note that the `no_std` HALs are still in the early phases of development, so not all peripherals have had drivers implemented.

|   Chip   |    PAC    |    HAL    |
| :------: | :-------: | :-------: |
|  ESP32   |    ✅     |    ✅     |
| ESP32-C2 | _planned_ | _planned_ |
| ESP32-C3 |    ✅     |    ✅     |
| ESP32-S2 |    ✅     |    ✅     |
| ESP32-S3 |    ✅     |    ✅     |
| ESP32-H2 | _planned_ | _planned_ |
| ESP8266  |    ✅     |    ✅     |
