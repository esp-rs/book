# Writing no_std applications
<!-- TODO ADD LINKS ONCE THE REPO IS IN ESP-RS ORG -->
If you want to learn how to develop `no_std` application, there is training developed for this:
- Book of training
- Repository of the training

The training is based on [ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1]. You can use any other Espressif development board but code changes and configuration changes might be needed.

<!-- TODO ADD LINKS ONCE THE REPO IS IN ESP-RS ORG -->
The training contains:
* Introductory level examples:
   * A basic hello-world (Source)
   * A panic example (Source)
   * A blinky example (Source)
   * A button example (Source)
   * A button with interrupt example (Source)

> Note that there are several examples covering the use of specific peripherals under the examples folder of every SoC [`esp-hal`]. E.g. [`esp32c3-hal/examples`]
