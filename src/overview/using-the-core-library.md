# Using the Core Library (`no_std`)

Using `no_std` may be more familiar to embedded Rust developers. It does not use `std` (the Rust [`standard`][rust-lib-std] library) but instead uses a subset, the [`core`][rust-lib-core] library. [The Embedded Rust Book][embedded-rust-book] has a great [section][embedded-rust-book-no-std] on this.

It is important to note that `no_std` uses the Rust `core` library. As this library is part of the Rust `standard` library, a `no_std` crate can compile in `std` environment. However, the opposite is not true: an `std` crate can't compile in `no_std` environment. This information is worth remembering when deciding which library to choose.

> ⚠️ **Note**:
>
> - ✅ in Wi-Fi/BLE/ESP-NOW means that the target supports, at least, one of the listed technologies. For details, see [Current support][esp-wifi-current-support] table of the esp-wifi repository.
> - [ESP8266 HAL][esp8266-hal] is in maintenance mode and no further development will be done for this chip.

### When You Might Want to Use the Core Library (`no_std`)

- Small memory footprint: If your embedded system has limited resources and needs to have a small memory footprint, you will likely want to use bare-metal because `std` features add a significant amount of final binary size and compilation time.
- Direct hardware control: If your embedded system requires more direct control over the hardware, such as low-level device drivers or access to specialized hardware features you will likely want to use bare-metal because `std` adds abstractions that can make it harder to interact directly with the hardware.
- Real-time constraints or time-critical applications: If your embedded system requires real-time performance or low-latency response times because `std` can introduce unpredictable delays and overhead that can affect real-time performance.
- Custom requirements: bare-metal allows more customization and fine-grained control over the behavior of an application, which can be useful in specialized or non-standard environments.
