# Getting Started

With an understanding of the ecosystem surrounding Rust on Espressif chips, we're able to move on to actual development. If you are not aware of the two possible development approaches, or do not understand the differences between writing `std` and `no_std` applications, please first read the [Ecosystem Overview] chapter.

In this chapter we will cover the installation of the correct Rust compiler and toolchain as well as creating applications.
