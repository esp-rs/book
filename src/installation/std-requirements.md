# `std` Development Requirements

Regardless of the target architecture, make sure you have the following required tools installed to build [`std`][rust-esp-book-overview-std] applications:

- [`python`][python-website-download]: Required by ESP-IDF
- [`git`][git-website-download]: Required by ESP-IDF
- [`ldproxy`][embuild-github-ldproxy] binary crate: A tool that forwards linker arguments to the actual linker that is also given as an argument to `ldproxy`. Install it by running:
    ```shell
    cargo install ldproxy
    ```

The `std` runtime uses [ESP-IDF][esp-idf-github] (Espressif IoT Development Framework) as hosted environment but, users do not need to install it. ESP-IDF is automatically downloaded and installed by [esp-idf-sys][esp-idf-sys-github], a crate that all `std` projects need to use, when building a `std` application.
