# Using the Standard Library (`std`)

Espressif provides a C-based development framework called [esp-idf][esp-idf-github] which has, or will have, support for all Espressif chips starting with the ESP32; note that this framework does _not_ support the ESP8266.

`esp-idf`, in turn, provides a [newlib][newlib-env] environment with enough functionality to build the Rust standard library (`std`) on top of it. This is the approach that is being taken to enable `std` support on ESP devices.

[newlib-env]: https://sourceware.org/newlib/

## Current Support

The Espressif products supported for Rust `std` development are the ones supported by the esp-idf framework. For details on different versions of esp-idf and support of Espressif chips, see [this table][esp-idf-release-compatibility].

[esp-idf-release-compatibility]: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf#esp-idf-release-and-soc-compatibility/

When using `std`, you have access to a lot of features that exist in [esp-idf][esp-idf-github], including threads, mutexes and other synchronization primitives, collections, random number generation, sockets...

| [esp-rs/esp-idf-svc]  | An implementation of [embedded-svc] using `esp-idf` drivers.                                                  |
| [esp-rs/esp-idf-hal]  | An implementation of the `embedded-hal` and other traits using the `esp-idf` framework.                       |
| [esp-rs/esp-idf-sys]  | Rust bindings to the `esp-idf` development framework. Gives raw (`unsafe`) access to drivers, Wi-Fi and more. |

The aforementioned crates have interdependencies, and this relationship can be seen below.

### When you might want to use the Standard Library (`std`)

- Rich functionality: If your embedded system requires lots of functionality like support for networking protocols, file I/O, or complex data structures, you will likely want to use hosted-environment approach because std libraries provide a wide range of functionality that can be used to build complex applications relatively quickly and efficiently
- Portability: The `std` crate provides a standardized set of APIs that can be used across different platforms and architectures, making it easier to write code that is portable and reusable.
- Rapid development: The `std` crate provides a rich set of functionality that can be used to build applications quickly and efficiently, without worrying, too much, about low-level details.
