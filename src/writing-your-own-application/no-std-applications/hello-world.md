# Hello World

In the last chapter you flashed and run your first piece of code on the SoC - while that is already really exciting we can do better.

Traditionally the first thing to run on a microcontroller is _blinky_.

However, we will start with _Hello World_ here.

## Add a Dependency

You can add a dependency by any of the following methods:

- By Editing `Cargo.toml`.
  In `Cargo.toml` in the `[dependencies]` section add this line:

```toml
esp-println = { version = "0.3.1", features = ["esp32c3"] }
```

- Using [`cargo add`]

```sh
cargo add esp-println --features "esp32c3"
```

[`esp-println`] is an additional crate that calls ROM functions to print text that is shown by [`espflash`] (or any other serial monitor).

We need to pass the feature `esp32c3` since that crate targets multiple SoCs and needs to know which one it is supposed to run on.

> Note that there might be new versions by the time you are reading this, please check [crates.io].

## Print Something

In `main.rs` before the `loop {}` add this line

```rust,ignore
esp_println::println!("Hello World");
```

## See Results

Again run

```shell
cargo run
```

You should see the text _Hello World_ printed!
