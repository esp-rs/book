# Blinky

Let's see how to create the iconic _Blinky_.

Change the code in `main.rs` to this
```rust,ignore
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use esp_backtrace as _;
use esp_println::println;
use hal::{
    clock::ClockControl, peripherals::Peripherals, prelude::*, timer::TimerGroup, Delay, Rtc, IO,
};
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
    let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
    let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();

    // Disable the RTC and TIMG watchdog timers
    let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.RTC_CNTL);
    let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);
    let mut wdt0 = timer_group0.wdt;
    let timer_group1 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG1, &clocks);
    let mut wdt1 = timer_group1.wdt;

    rtc.swd.disable();
    rtc.rwdt.disable();
    wdt0.disable();
    wdt1.disable();

    println!("Hello world!");

    // Set GPIO7 as an output, and set its state high initially.
    let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
    let mut led = io.pins.gpio7.into_push_pull_output();

    led.set_high().unwrap();

    // Initialize the Delay peripheral, and use it to toggle the LED state in a
    // loop.
    let mut delay = Delay::new(&clocks);

    loop {
        led.toggle().unwrap();
        delay.delay_ms(500u32);
    }
}
```

We need two new types in scope: [`IO`] and [`Delay`]

On [ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1] there is a regular [LED connected to GPIO 7]. If you use another board consult the data-sheet.

> Note that most of the development boards from Espressif today use an addressable LED which works differently and is beyond the scope of this book. In that case, you can also connect a regular LED to some of the free pins (and don't forget to add a resistor).

Here we see that we can drive the pin `high`, `low`, or `toggle` it.

We also see that the HAL offers a way to delay execution.
