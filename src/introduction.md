# Introduction

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive guide on using the [Rust Programming Language] with [Espressif] devices.

[rust programming language]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[espressif]: https://espressif.com/

Rust support for these devices is still a work in progress, and progress is being made rapidly. Because of this, parts of this documentation may be out of date or change dramatically between readings.

For tools and libraries relating to Rust on ESP, please see the [esp-rs organization] on GitHub. This organization is managed by employees of Espressif as well as members of the community.

> **A Note on Device Support**
>
> The contents of this book apply to the ESP32 series of devices only; this
> includes:
>
> - ESP32 Series
> - ESP32 C-Series
> - ESP32 S-Series
>
> The ESP8266 series is outside the scope of this book. Rust support for the
> ESP8266 series is limited and is not being officially supported by Espressif.

## Who This Book is For

This book is intended for people with some experience with Rust, and also assumes rudimentary knowledge of embedded development and electronics. For those without prior experience, we recommend first reading the [Assumptions and Prerequisites] and [Other Resources] sections to get up to speed.

[assumptions and prerequisites]: #assumptions-and-prerequisites
[other resources]: #other-resources

### Assumptions and Prerequisites

- You are comfortable using the Rust Programming Language, and have written and run applications in a desktop environment.
- You should be familiar with the idioms of the [2021 edition], as this book targets Rust 2021.
- You are comfortable developing embedded systems in another language such as C or C++, and are familiar with concepts such as:
  - Cross-compilation
  - Common digital interfaces like `UART`, `SPI`, `IÂ²C`, etc.
  - Memory-mapped peripherals
  - Interrupts
